# Docker
- Docker uses a containerization approach that shares the host operating system kernel and isolates applications using containers. 
- Containers are lightweight and efficient which means that they use fewer resources and can start up quickly. 
- Docker images are also typically smaller in size than VM images.

# Virtual Machines
- VMs simulate an entire operating system and run on top of a host operating system. 
- Each VM runs its own copy of the operating system and applications which can make them more resource-intensive and slower to start up than other containerization technologies. 
- VMs also tend to be larger in size because they require an entire operating system to be installed on each instance.

# Summary
- Overall, both Docker and virtual machines have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them should be based on the specific needs of the application. 
- Virtual machines may be better suited for applications that require complete isolation from the host operating system, while Docker may be more appropriate for applications that require high portability, efficiency, and scalability.
