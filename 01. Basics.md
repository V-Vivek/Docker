# What is Docker?
- Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to build, test, deploy and run applications in containers.
- Docker packages software into standardized units called containers.
- Docker can help us in easy deployment & scaling.

# Docker File
- A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image.
- It typically includes instructions for installing dependencies, copying application code and configuring the environment.
- The Dockerfile is used as a blueprint for building a Docker image.

# Docker Image
- It is a packaged, executable software artifact that contains everything needed to run an application, including the application code, libraries and other dependencies. 
- It is created from a Dockerfile and can be thought of as a snapshot of an application and its dependencies at a specific point in time.
- Docker images can be distributed and run on any machine that supports Docker, making it easier to deploy applications across different environments.

# Docker Container
- It is a running instance of a Docker image. 
- It is an isolated environment that runs an application and its dependencies.
- It provides a lightweight, portable way to run applications consistently across different computing environments.
- Multiple containers can be run on a single machine and containers can be scaled up or down as needed to meet demand.
