# Volume mounting
- Volume mounting in Docker is a way to share data between the host machine and the Docker container. 
- When you create a volume, Docker creates a directory on the host machine and mounts it into the container at a specified path. 
- This allows data to be persisted outside the container and survive container restarts.

## Creating a volume inside container
- This will create a directory named data in the container and mount it to the host machine.
```
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Mount the host directory to the container directory
VOLUME /app/data

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## Mounting volume
- Syntax
```
docker run -vc[host-folder-path]:[container-folder-path] <image-name>
```
- For. e.g. This will mount the /path/to/host/directory directory on the host machine to the /app/data directory in the container. 
- Any data written to /app/data in the container will be persisted on the host machine.
```
docker run -v /path/to/host/directory:/app/data myapp
```
