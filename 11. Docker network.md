# Docker Network
- Docker network is a feature that allows containers to communicate with each other securely and efficiently.
- It provides an isolated virtual network that allows containers to connect to each other without the need for exposing their ports to the outside world.
- The default network type is ***bridge***, which allows containers to communicate with each other using a shared network interface.

## Create network
- You can create a Docker network using the docker network create command:
```
docker network create [OPTIONS] <netwrok-name>
```
- For e.g. :
```
docker network create mynetwork
```

## Assign network to a container
- Once you have created a Docker network, you can use the --network option when running a container to connect it to the network:
```
docker run --network=<netwrok-name> [OPTIONS] <immage-name>
```
- For e.g. :
```
docker run --network=mynetwork myimage
```
