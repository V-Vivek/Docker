# Monolithic Architecture
- In a monolithic architecture, the application is built as a single, unified system. 
- All the different components of the application, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layer are packaged together and run on a single server.
- This architecture is simpler to develop and deploy, but can become difficult to maintain and scale as the application grows in size and complexity.
- Monolithic architecture may be a good fit for smaller, simpler applications with lower traffic

# Microservice Architecture
- A microservice architecture breaks down the application into smaller, independent services each with its own specific function. 
- These services communicate with each other through APIs and can be developed, deployed and scaled independently of each other. 
- This architecture is more complex to develop and deploy, but offers greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience.
- Microservice architecture may be more appropriate for larger, complex applications that require high scalability and fault tolerance.
